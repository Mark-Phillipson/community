Please can you investigate if there is a voice command in this repository to list all the emotion icons.

 there is definitely a voice command like the following:

 emoji happy

 that produces:

 😀

  but there does not appear to be one that lists the available ones.

   please do not create any new commands in this repository I'm just asking the question.
